## Bio

Hi! My name is Zhian Chen or you are welcome to call me Andy. I have recently received my first master's degree from UC Santa Barbara. My research areas are norm (mis)perception and parental investment in humans. As many of you may have noticed, I have a service dog and his name is **Oolong tea**. However, what you may not know is that Oolong tea has a feline sister and her name is *Dengdeng*. ![](Oolong_and_Dengdeng.png)

## Three random/fun things about me

- I am a human behavior ecologist. [Who are human behavior ecologists and what do they do?](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/25/3/443/2900492)

-  My previous study site was in the Mwanza region of Tanzania. It is a lovely and urbanizing place! [Where is Mwanza?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwanza_Region)



## A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown

For the workflow, I first pulled the assignment from Github with the gitclone command after setting my directory for the course. Then, I followed the instructions within the assignment by editing the README markdone file. Lastly, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to push the edited file to the Github repo.

Most of my experience with Github and Markdown is from R Studio. The interface of Github in R Studio is quite straightforward and pushing or pulling files does not require any commands. Therefore, writing commands for pushing and pulling files from Github in the terminal of VS Code is new to me. Moreover, I initally thought Markdown file is only used in R Studio. Apparently, it is a file format that can be used in different programs (if I understand correctly).
